Thanks for the screenshots, Rivaal — I can see you’re in your GitHub repo (rivpadayachee-cmd/test) and your GitHub Pages deployment is stuck in “queued.” Let’s walk through exactly what you need to do next to fix it and get your site live.

✅ Step-by-Step Fix for GitHub Pages Deployment
🔧 Step 1: Enable GitHub Pages
- Go to your repo’s Settings tab.
- Scroll down to Pages (left sidebar).
- Under Source, select:
- Branch: main (or gh-pages if you’re using that)
- Folder: /root or /docs (depending on where your HTML files are)
- Click Save.

🛠️ Step 2: Create a Simple index.html
- In your repo, click Add file → Create new file.
- Name it index.html.
- Paste this sample code:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>My Maths App</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Welcome to Rivaal’s Maths Resource</h1>
  <p>This is a test deployment using GitHub Pages.</p>
</body>
</html>
- Scroll down and click Commit new file.

⚙️ Step 3: Check Deployment Status
- Go to the Actions tab.
- Look for a workflow called pages-build-deployment.
- If it’s stuck:
- Click into it.
- Cancel the job.
- Re-run it manually.

🧠 Step 4: Add a Workflow File (if missing)
If you don’t have .github/workflows/pages.yml, create one:
- Click Add file → Create new file.
- Name it .github/workflows/pages.yml.
- Paste this:
name: Deploy to GitHub Pages

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Setup Pages
        uses: actions/configure-pages@v3

      - name: Upload artifact
        uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v1
        with:
          path: .

      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v2
- Commit the file.

🚀 Final Step: Push a Change
- Edit your index.html or README and push the change.
- This will trigger the workflow and deploy your site.

Once this is done, your site should be live at:
https://rivpadayachee-cmd.github.io/test/
